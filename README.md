Smart Grievance Redressal Portal (Non-Hardware)  Problem: Citizens often face difficulties in raising complaints about civic issues (potholes, garbage, streetlights not working) and tracking their resolution.  
Project features
Citizen mobile/web app
Complaint submission: A user-friendly interface allows citizens to register complaints with a description and location details.
Photo upload: Users can upload pictures to provide visual evidence of the civic issue.
Location services: The app leverages GPS to automatically pinpoint the location of the complaint for accurate and faster resolution.
Unique tracking ID: After submission, the system generates a unique ID for each complaint, which is sent to the user via SMS, email, or an in-app notification.
Complaint status tracking: Users can view the real-time status of their complaint (e.g., Pending, In Progress, Resolved) through a personal dashboard.
Automated notifications: Citizens receive automatic alerts when the complaint status changes, ensuring they are informed of the progress.
Feedback mechanism: After a complaint is resolved, citizens can provide feedback on the quality of the resolution and can reopen the complaint if they are not satisfied.
User-friendly design: The app is designed for accessibility and ease of use, with a clear layout and simple navigation.
Digital transparency dashboard (Admin)
Complaint management: A centralized, web-based dashboard allows municipal administrators and assigned personnel to view, manage, and assign incoming complaints.
Real-time data monitoring: The dashboard displays live updates on complaint volumes, resolution times, and active issues, enabling data-driven decision-making.
Assignment and routing: Based on the complaint category and location, the system can automatically assign the issue to the appropriate department or field officer.
Performance metrics: The dashboard offers analytics and reporting features that highlight performance trends, identify bottlenecks, and measure departmental efficiency.
Escalation alerts: If a complaint remains unresolved after a set period, the system automatically escalates it to higher authorities, promoting accountability.
Proof of resolution: Field employees can upload photos and comments to the dashboard as evidence when marking a complaint as resolved.
Public view: The dashboard can include a public-facing section with aggregate data (e.g., number of resolved complaints per month) to build trust and increase transparency.
Core user workflows
Citizen journey
Sign up/Log in: Citizen registers or logs in with a mobile number and/or email.
Lodge a complaint: The user fills out a form with a title, description, and complaint category, and uploads a photo.
Confirm location: The app uses GPS to set the location, which the user can manually adjust.
Receive unique ID: The citizen gets a notification with a unique tracking number.
Track status: The user checks their personal dashboard for updates, with status changes and progress noted on a timeline.
Receive resolution notification: When the complaint is resolved, the user receives an alert with a "Resolved" image and status update.
Provide feedback: The citizen can rate the resolution or reopen the complaint if dissatisfied.
Administrator journey
View dashboard: The admin logs into the web dashboard to see a list of all complaints, with filters for status, category, and priority.
Assign complaint: The admin assigns a new complaint to a relevant field officer.
Receive notification: The assigned officer receives a notification on their mobile app or web panel.
Resolve complaint: The field officer goes to the location, resolves the issue, and uploads a photo of the completed work.
Update status: The officer marks the complaint as "Resolved," triggering a notification to the citizen.
Monitor performance: The admin uses reports and analytics to review resolution times and departmental performance.
Technology stack
The following stack provides a robust, scalable, and non-hardware solution:
Frontend (Mobile/Web App): Flutter or React Native allows a single codebase to be deployed on both iOS and Android, while a web front-end can be built with React.
Backend: A robust framework like Laravel (PHP) or Django (Python) can manage user authentication, data processing, and API endpoints.
Database: A relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL is suitable for managing user data, complaints, and status history.
Location services: Integration with a mapping API (e.g., Google Maps API) will enable geotagging and location-based filtering of complaints.
Notification service: An external service like Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or Twilio can be used to send automated notifications.
Cloud infrastructure: The application and database can be hosted on a cloud service like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure for scalability.
Data security and privacy
Anonymity: Users can be given the option to file certain types of complaints anonymously to protect their privacy.
Secure protocols: All data transmission will use secure protocols (HTTPS) to protect user data from interception.
Compliance: The system should adhere to relevant data protection regulations, such as India's Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.
Limited data collection: Only essential personal information is collected, with users informed about the purpose of data collection.
